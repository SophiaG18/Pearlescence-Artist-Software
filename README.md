# Pearlescence-Artist-Software

Group Name: Pearlescence

Group Members: Anna Fang, Sophia Gao

Prototype: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ_F--UWB9xtafvUVpv_5qi4pqOymIEEmPG7aE3nx1g/edit?usp=sharing

### Brief Project Summary:
Our project will be processing based and will emulate a digital art software. The product will be an interactive interface resembling programs like MSPaint, with the top of the screen being an interactive “toolbar” with the rest of the screen available for the user to draw in. It will contain various brushes that allow the user to create different size lines, special tools such as a “fill-bucket” and “shape creators”, a color selector, eraser, and a way for the user to save their drawing via screenshot. Building on from this, we would like our project to include aspects of more advanced programs like procreate such as brush weight (based on the user’s selection of transparency and brush), layers, and layer manipulation (ex: multiply, color dodge, etc).
