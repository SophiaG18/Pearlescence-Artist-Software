# Pearlescence-Artist-Software

Group Name: Pearlescence

Group Members: Anna Fang, Sophia Gao

Prototype: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ_F--UWB9xtafvUVpv_5qi4pqOymIEEmPG7aE3nx1g/edit?usp=sharing

### Brief Project Summary:
Our project will be processing based and will emulate a digital art software. The product will be an interactive interface resembling programs like MSPaint, with the top of the screen being an interactive “toolbar” with the rest of the screen available for the user to draw in. It will contain various brushes that allow the user to create different size lines, special tools such as a “fill-bucket” and “shape creators”, a color selector, eraser, and a way for the user to save their drawing via screenshot. Building on from this, we would like our project to include aspects of more advanced programs like procreate such as brush weight (based on the user’s selection of transparency and brush), layers, and layer manipulation (ex: multiply, color dodge, etc).

### Compile/Run Instructions:



### Document Log:
##### 5/23:
Sophia Gao:
Created the processing folder with tabs then streamlined Anna's code. Draw method now includes text for all variables except brushMode, which had unexpected complications in calling respective Brush method.

Anna Fang:
Finished writing keypressed method in main file and both pen() and eraser() according to outlined requirements in Brush tab. Accidentally forgot to use —no-ff, but will make sure to use it in the future.

##### 5/24:
Sophia Gao: Finished Pearlescence phase 1. Currently in phase 2 of Pearlescence with the RGB section finished.

Anna Fang:
Updated Pearlescence by moving mousePressed into the draw method and implemented pmouseX/pmouseY in order to shift from using mouse coords. to make a trail of circles to a series of lines. Also fixed up coordinates in Pen() and Eraser().

##### 5/25:
Sophia Gao: Coded a modified version of imageProcessing lab as Kernel tab. Continued Pearlescence phase 2.

Anna Fang:


##### 5/26:
Sophia Gao: Coded a non-recursive Bucket2 that is decently fast.
